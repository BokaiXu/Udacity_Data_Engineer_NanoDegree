# Introduction:

#### A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.

# Descrpition of project:

#### In this project, I applied what I've learned on data modeling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, I model my data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. I am provided with part of the ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.

# Files:

#### event_data contains the data seperated by date
#### images contains a example of the event_datafile_new.csv
#### event_datafile_new.csv is the cleaned data
#### Project_1B_Project.ipynb is the notebook to create and insert data into the table.

# How to use:
#### Open the ipynb file using Jupyter Notobook and run the commands.
